    <h2>Why Kozea Community?</h2>
    <p>
      We think that projects become interesting when they're fun <em>and</em>
      when they're used by real users in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think that goals are strong when they're clearly announced at the
      beginning <em>and</em> when they're clearly followed when taking
      decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We think that using our own tools on a regular basis is the only way to
      make them better and better.
